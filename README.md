# abm-landlab-mini-workshop

This repository contains materials for an informal virtual workshop on coupling agent-based models (ABMs) and grid-based numerical models, June 3, 2020.

## Draft agenda

The workshop will be held Wednesday, June 3, 2020, starting at 4pm EDT, 3pm CDT, 2pm MDT, 1pm MST/PDT. Times below are relative to the start time:

0:00 Welcome & goals

0:10  Sharing interests in coupled ABM-biophysical models: go around the “room,” <=5 min each, can include a slide or two if you wish

0:50 Greg Tucker: quick introduction to Landlab; example of coupled model built with Landlab + Mesa (sheep-wolves-grass + soil erosion and transport)

1:10 Matt Rossi: quick introduction to pyNetLogo; example of a coupled model of tree growth, rock weathering, and soil transport

1:30 Discussion of a potential “ABM-biophysical collection”, and potential paper? (Proposal?)

1:45 For those interested: continue by organizing into small groups to experiment with some of these tools

2:45 Regroup and compare notes; plan next steps

3:00 end



## Tools

We'll be looking at examples that use three Python-based tools. Below are links to learn more about these.

### Landlab

[Landlab](https://landlab.github.io) is a Python-language programming library for building and exploring two-dimension, grid-based numerical models. The package includes an extensive set of [tutorials](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorials.html).

### pyNetLogo 

[pyNetLogo](https://pynetlogo.readthedocs.io) is a package for running netLogo-based ABMs in a Python environment. The package includes three simple examples for getting up and running quickly.

### Mesa 

[Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io) is a Python-language ABM modeling package. It uses an object-oriented design somewhat similar to Landlab's. The documentation includes a nice introductory tutorial.
